A few demos how to use deep learning for classification of small data sets for marketing and cyber-security

Here below a list of resources to complement the presentation, about Deep Learning, Supervised Data Science,  Classification, and the reference to the dataset used

Datasets:

Churn, artificial, based on actual data: http://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.names 

Customer churn data: The MLC++ software package contains a number of machine learning data sets. The "churn" data set was developed to predict telecom customer churn based on information about their account. The data files state that the data are "artificial based on claims similar to real world". These data are also contained in the C50 R package.
